title: Get Physics
---

This website is dedicated to pooling together all the online resources for studying physics. Most of the videos and links are geared towards first year physics classes. However, I think far to often we get lost in the problems given in class, that we forget the really enjoyable side of physics. That is I have added a whole entire section of physics related videos that really are mind blowing. I hope that beyond learning how to solve problems, these videos will inspire youas well.
